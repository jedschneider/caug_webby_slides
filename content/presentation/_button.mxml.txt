<% uv :lang => 'actionscript', :line_numbers => true, :theme => 'twilight' do -%>
<!-- here is a button marked up in mxml -->
<s:Button 
	label="Hello World" 
	click="{Alert.show('hello world')}" 
	added="doHelloWorldAdded(event)" 
	styleName="helloWorldBtn"
	/>
<% end -%>

and, thats pretty much it!

* click => can add inline actionscript inside braces
* added => can refer to a function elsewhere in the file or application
* styleName => can use CSS to markup components
